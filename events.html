            screenings. The event, moderated by NSS coordinators targeted
            beneficiaries encompassing MAHE Bengaluru campus members, including
            students, faculty, and staff, contributing to a collective effort to
            spread awareness, offer support, and fund research initiatives for

          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the awareness campaign, the NSS team sensitized
            participants about breast cancer risks, the importance of early
            detection, and the experiences of survivors. Pink ribbons were
            distributed alongside group photographs taken as a symbol of
            solidarity. The event culminated in a "Pink Day" where participants
            dressed in pink attire, demonstrating their commitment to the cause.
            The campaign's success was reflected in the active participation of
            over 400+ individuals and aimed to encourage healthy lifestyles
            while emphasizing the significance of early detection in combating
            breast cancer.

        <h3 class="event-heading">BLOOD DONATION CAMP</h3>
        <div class="para-events">
          <p>
            Volunteer Services Organization (VSO) MAHE, organised a blood
            donation drive at the MAHE Bengaluru campus on April 1st, 2023. This
            event aimed to encourage voluntary blood donation, emphasizing its
            pivotal role in saving lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            What distinguished this drive, was the active involvement of the NSS
            (National Service Scheme) Unit from MIT-BLR, who not only
            volunteered their services but also wholeheartedly participated by
            donating blood. Their dedication and commitment to this noble cause
            significantly contributed to the success of the blood camp.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the joint efforts of VSO and the NSS Unit from MIT-BLR, the
            blood camp witnessed a substantial turnout. The willingness of the
            NSS volunteers to not only offer their time and support but also
            actively engage in blood donation exemplifies the spirit of altruism
            and compassion within the academic community.

        <h3 class="event-heading">ELECTORAL VOTER RIGHTS CAMPAIGN</h3>
        <div class="para-events">
          <p>
            The NSS MIT-BLR Unit, in collaboration with the Electoral Literacy
            Club, conducted an Electoral Voting Rights Campaign in
            Gantiganahalli village on March 25, 2023. The primary objective of
            this initiative was to raise awareness about voting rights and the
            significance of possessing a voter's ID card among the villagers.
            Understanding that voting is a crucial right for citizens aged 18
            and above, the campaign aimed to ensure that these individuals were
            equipped with the necessary documentation to exercise their voting
            rights during the upcoming elections.
          </p>
          <p>
            The event catered specifically to the residents of Gantiganahalli
            village, aligning with the impending state-wide election. By
            engaging with the villagers, the NSS volunteers from MIT Bengaluru
            emphasized the pivotal role voting plays in shaping fair
            representation and decision-making processes. Through door-to-door
            interactions, they reached 116 houses, involving 584 individuals.
            Among them, 433 were eligible voters aged 18 or older, and an
            impressive 421 possessed valid voter ID cards. The campaign not only
            focused on increasing awareness but also facilitated the voter
            registration process for those who lacked the necessary
            documentation.
